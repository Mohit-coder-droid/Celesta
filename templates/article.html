                <h3>overview</h3>
                <p>Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the poliovirus. It primarily affects young children, but it can also occur in adults. The virus is transmitted from person to person, primarily through fecal-oral contact or less commonly through respiratory droplets. <br>
                There are three types of poliovirus: type 1, type 2, and type 3. Infection with any of these types can lead to polio, although type 2 has been eradicated globally and no cases have been reported since 1999.<br>
                There are two forms of polio:<br>
                1.	Non-paralytic polio (abortive polio): This form of polio is less severe and accounts for the majority of cases. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle stiffness.<br>
                2.	Paralytic polio: This is a more serious form of the disease. In a small percentage of cases, the virus can invade and damage the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness or paralysis. Paralytic polio can affect the limbs, breathing muscles, or even the brainstem.<br>
                In severe cases, polio can lead to long-term disability or even death, particularly if the muscles used for breathing become paralyzed.<br>
                Polio was a major public health concern in the early to mid-20th century, causing widespread outbreaks and significant morbidity and mortality. However, thanks to the development of effective vaccines, such as the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and the oral polio vaccine (OPV), widespread vaccination campaigns, and global efforts, polio has been largely eradicated in many parts of the world.<br>
                As of my last training data in early 2022, significant progress had been made in eradicating the disease, with only a few countries still reporting cases. The aim of global health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), is to achieve complete eradication of polio worldwide. They continue to conduct vaccination campaigns and surveillance efforts to achieve this goal.</p>
                
                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>The symptoms of polio can vary depending on the severity of the infection. There are two main forms of polio: non-paralytic (abortive) and paralytic. <br>
                1.	Non-paralytic (Abortive) Polio:<br>
                •	Fever<br>
                •	Sore throat<br>
                •	Headache<br>
                •	Nausea and vomiting<br>
                •	Fatigue<br>
                •	Muscle stiffness or tenderness<br>
                •	Meningitis-like symptoms (e.g., sensitivity to light, irritability)<br>
                These symptoms are generally milder and can be mistaken for other viral infections.<br>
                2.	Paralytic Polio:<br>
                •	In severe cases, after the initial non-specific symptoms, individuals may experience a period of improvement followed by a sudden onset of more severe symptoms, including:<br>
                •	Weakness or paralysis, usually asymmetrical (i.e., affecting one side of the body more than the other)<br>
                •	Loss of reflexes in affected limbs<br>
                •	Severe muscle pain and spasms<br>
                •	Difficulty swallowing and/or breathing (if respiratory muscles are affected)<br>
                •	Bowel and bladder dysfunction<br>
                It's important to note that not everyone infected with the poliovirus develops paralytic symptoms. In fact, the majority of people who contract the virus may have mild or no symptoms at all.<br>
                Additionally, some individuals who recover from paralytic polio may experience a late-onset condition called post-polio syndrome (PPS) later in life. PPS is characterized by a gradual onset of new muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue, which can occur decades after the initial infection.</p>
                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>Currently, there is no specific antiviral medication to treat polio. Instead, the focus of treatment is on supportive care and rehabilitation. Here are some key aspects of the treatment of polio: <br>
                1.	Supportive Care:<br>
                •	Bed Rest: In the acute phase of the illness, especially for those with paralytic polio, bed rest may be recommended to conserve energy and prevent further muscle damage.<br>
                •	Pain Management: Over-the-counter pain relievers or prescription medications may be used to manage pain and discomfort.<br>
                2.	Physical Therapy:<br>
                •	Range of Motion Exercises: Physical therapists can help patients perform exercises to maintain or improve joint flexibility and prevent contractures (shortening of muscles or tendons).<br>
                •	Strengthening Exercises: Exercises to build and maintain muscle strength in unaffected areas can help compensate for weakness in affected limbs.<br>
                3.	Occupational Therapy:<br>
                •	Occupational therapists can assist with activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, feeding) and provide adaptive equipment if needed.<br>
                4.	Respiratory Support:<br>
                •	For individuals with respiratory muscle weakness, mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support may be necessary.<br>
                5.	Mobility Aids and Orthotics:<br>
                •	Depending on the extent of muscle weakness or paralysis, mobility aids like wheelchairs, braces, or crutches may be prescribed to help with mobility.<br>
                6.	Speech and Swallowing Therapy:<br>
                •	Speech therapists can help individuals with swallowing difficulties and provide exercises to improve speech and communication.<br>
                7.	Management of Complications:<br>
                •	Complications such as respiratory infections, pressure sores, and urinary tract infections need to be promptly addressed.<br>
                8.	Psychosocial Support:<br>
                •	Coping with the physical and emotional challenges of polio may require support from mental health professionals and support groups.<br>
                It's important to note that prevention through vaccination is the most effective way to combat polio. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) have been instrumental in reducing the incidence of the disease globally.<br>
